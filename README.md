### Introduction
This is my MSBA capstone project. The primary dataset includes text data from 194 hours' convention speech from both Democratic and Republican parties from 2004 to 2020. Our data sources are rev.com 
      and C-SPAN.org. The textual data was transformed to a SQLite database with 3470 rows and 9 columns including `year`, `party`, `day`, `speaker`, `speaker count`, `time`, `text`, `text length`, and `the source of text`.
